# Quiz-app
A fun quiz game made with HTML, CSS and javascript
uses a trivia api to generate questions and has different modes: easy, medium, hard and survival
survival mode has not yet been coded completely
the idea for survival mode is to create a combination of all the previous modes, add a score counter and a timing function with the time gradually decreasing as the player progresses
